# LAS File Upload Logging Feature

## Overview
When you upload a LAS file, the Python Logs panel at the bottom of the screen now displays detailed, step-by-step logs of the upload process with color-coded messages and emojis for better visibility.

## How It Works

### 1. **Upload a LAS File**
   - Go to **File → New Well** or click the well creation button
   - Select the **LAS File** tab
   - Choose your LAS file

### 2. **Watch the Logs**
   The **Python Logs** panel at the bottom will show:

   📁 **Starting LAS file upload...**
   - Initial upload started
   
   📄 **File selected: your-file.las**
   - Shows the filename being uploaded
   
   💾 **Saving file as: your-file.las**
   - File is being saved temporarily
   
   🔍 **Parsing LAS file...**
   - Reading and parsing the LAS file format
   
   ✅ **LAS file parsed successfully**
   - File parsed without errors
   
   📊 **Well Name: WELL-001**
   - Displays the well name from the LAS file
   
   📊 **Well Type: oil**
   - Shows the well type
   
   📈 **Found 15 log curves**
   - Number of log curves detected in the file
   
   💾 **Saving well to project...**
   - Saving the parsed data to your project
   
   ✅ **Well saved to: /path/to/well.ptrc**
   - File saved successfully with path
   
   ✅ **LAS file copied to: /path/to/las-file.las**
   - Original LAS file copied to project
   
   🎉 **Well "WELL-001" created successfully!**
   - Upload complete!

### 3. **Error Handling**
   If something goes wrong, you'll see:
   
   ❌ **Error: Invalid file type**
   - Shows specific error messages
   
   ❌ **Upload failed: reason**
   - Clear error description

## Log Types

The logs are color-coded for easy reading:
- **INFO** (Blue): General information messages
- **SUCCESS** (Green): Successful operations
- **ERROR** (Red): Errors or failures
- **WARNING** (Yellow): Warning messages

## Benefits

✅ **Real-time Feedback**: See exactly what's happening during upload
✅ **Easy Debugging**: Identify issues immediately with detailed error messages
✅ **Progress Tracking**: Know when each step completes
✅ **Professional UI**: Clean, emoji-enhanced logs for better user experience

## Example Output

```
📁 Starting LAS file upload...
📄 File selected: sample-well.las
💾 Saving file as: sample-well.las
🔍 Parsing LAS file...
✅ LAS file parsed successfully
📊 Well Name: SAMPLE-001
📊 Well Type: gas
📈 Found 12 log curves
💾 Saving well to project...
✅ Well saved to: /workspace/project/10-WELLS/SAMPLE-001.ptrc
✅ LAS file copied to: /workspace/project/02-INPUT_LAS_FOLDER/sample-well.las
🎉 Well "SAMPLE-001" created successfully!
```

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Flask API returns structured log messages with type and message
- **Frontend**: NewWellDialog component displays logs using `window.addPythonLog()`
- **Panel**: Python Logs panel (FeedbackPanelNew component) renders color-coded logs
- **Auto-scroll**: Logs automatically scroll to show latest messages
